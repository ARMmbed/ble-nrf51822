 *
 * @details This module implements the TX Power Service with the TX Power Level characteristic.
 *          During initialization it adds the TX Power Service and TX Power Level characteristic
 *          with the specified initial value to the BLE stack database.
 *
 *          It provides a function for letting the application update the TX Power Level
 *          characteristic.
 *

 *  To maintain compliance with Nordic Semiconductor ASA Bluetooth profile 
 *  qualification listings, this section of source code must not be modified.
