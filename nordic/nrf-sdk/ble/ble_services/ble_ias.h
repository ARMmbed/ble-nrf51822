 * @brief Immediate Alert Service module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the Immediate Alert Service with the Alert Level characteristic.
 *          During initialization it adds the Immediate Alert Service and Alert Level characteristic
 *          to the BLE stack database.
 *
 *          The application must supply an event handler for receiving Immediate Alert Service 
 *          events. Using this handler, the service will notify the application when the 
 *          Alert Level characteristic value changes.
 *
 *          The service also provides a function for letting the application poll the current
 *          value of the Alert Level characteristic.
 *
 * @note The application must propagate BLE stack events to the Immediate Alert Service
 *       module by calling ble_ias_on_ble_evt() from the @ref ble_stack_handler callback.
 *
 * @note Attention! 
 *  To maintain compliance with Nordic Semiconductor ASA Bluetooth profile 
 *  qualification listings, this section of source code must not be modified.
