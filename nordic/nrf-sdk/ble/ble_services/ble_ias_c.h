 * @brief Immediate Alert Service Client module
 *
 * @details This module implements the Immediate Alert Service client - locator role of the Find Me
 *          profile. On @ref BLE_GAP_EVT_CONNECTED event, this module starts discovery of the
 *          Immediate Alert Service with Alert Level characteristic at the peer. This module will
 *          indicate the application about a successful service & characteristic discovery using
 *          @ref BLE_IAS_C_EVT_CHAR_DISCOVERED event. The application can use @ref
 *          ble_ias_c_send_alert_level function to signal alerts to the peer.
 *
 * @note The application must propagate BLE stack events to this module by calling
 *       ble_ias_c_on_ble_evt() from the from the @ref ble_stack_handler callback function.
