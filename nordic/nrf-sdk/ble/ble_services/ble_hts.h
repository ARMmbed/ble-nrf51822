 *          If an event handler is supplied by the application, the Health Thermometer

 *
 * @note The application must propagate BLE stack events to the Health Thermometer Service
 *       module by calling ble_hts_on_ble_evt() from the from the @ref ble_stack_handler function.
 *
 * @note Attention!
