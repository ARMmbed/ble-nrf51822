/**@brief Function for handling the Debug assert, which can be called from an error handler. 
 *        To be used only for debugging purposes.
 *
 *@details This code will copy the filename and line number into local variables for them to always
 *         be accessible in Keil debugger. The function will also write the ARM Cortex-M0 stack 
 *         memory into flash where it can be retrieved and manually un-winded in order to 
 *         back-trace the location where the error ocured.<br>
 * @warning <b>ALL INTERRUPTS WILL BE DISABLED.</b>
 * 
 * @note    This function will never return but loop forever for debug purposes.
 *
 * @param[in] error_code  Error code supplied to the handler.
 * @param[in] line_num    Line number where the original handler is called.
 * @param[in] p_file_name Pointer to the file name.
