/**@brief Function for processing the encoded GAP command from Application Chip.
 *
 * @details     This function will decode the encoded command and call the appropriate BLE Stack
 *              API. It will then create a Command Response packet with the return value from the
 *              stack API encoded in it and will send it to the transport layer for transmission to
 *              the application controller chip.

 * @param[in]   p_command      The encoded command.
 * @param[in]   op_code        Operation code of the command.
 * @param[in]   command_len    Length of the encoded command.
 *
 * @retval      NRF_SUCCESS    If the decoding of the command was successful, the soft device API
 *                             was called, and the command response was sent to peer, otherwise an
 *                             error code.
 *                             If the transport layer returns an error code while sending
 *                             the Command Response, the same error code will be returned by this
 *                             function (see @ref hci_transport_pkt_write for the list of
 *                             error codes).
