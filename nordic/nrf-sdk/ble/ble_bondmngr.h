 * @ingroup ble_sdk_lib
 * @brief This module handles multiple bonds and persistent attributes.
 *
 * @details When using <i>Bluetooth</i> low energy, a central device and a peripheral device can
 *          exchange identification information which they are capable of storing in memory (for
 *          example, in non-volatile memory). This information can be used for identity verification
 *          between the devices when they reconnect in the future. This relationship is known as a
 *          'bond'.
 *
 *          <b>Bonding Information:</b>
 *
 *          The S110 SoftDevice handles the BLE on-air transactions necessary to establish a new
 *          bond or to use a previous bond when it reconnects to a bonded central. It is however up
 *          to the application layer to memorize the <i>identification information</i> between
 *          connections and to provide them back to the S110 stack when it detects a re-connection
 *          from a previously bonded central. This identification information is referred to as
 *          Bonding Information in code and the SDK.
 *
 *          <b>System Attributes:</b>
 *
 *          If the application is a GATT server, it stores a set of persistent attributes related
 *          to a connection when bonding with a central. On reconnection with the known bonded
 *          central, the application restores the related persistent attributes in the last known
 *          state back to the S110 SoftDevice. These persistent attributes mainly include the Client
 *          Characteristic Configuration Descriptor (or CCCD, see the <i><b>Bluetooth</b>
 *          Core Specification</i> for more information) states and could include other attributes
 *          in the future. Persistent attributes are referred to as System Attributes in code and
 *          in the SDK documentation.
 *
 *          An application can use the Bonds and Persistent Data Manager module (referred to as the
 *          bond manager)  included in the nRF51 SDK to handle most of the operations related to
 *          the Bonding Information and System Attributes. The bond manager notifies the
 *          application when it's connected to a new bonded central or to a previously bonded central.
 *          The application can use the Bond Manager API to store or load (or restore) the
 *          Bonding Information and System Attributes. The bond manager identifies all the centrals
 *          the application is bonded to and restores their respective Bonding Information and
 *          System Attributes to the S110 stack.
 *
 *          In addition, you can use the bond manager to set up your application to advertise:
 *
 *          - To a given bonded central using directed advertisement.
 *          - To a list of bonded centrals - i.e. using whitelist.
 *
 *          The bond manager automatically writes the Bonding Information to the flash memory when
 *          the bonding procedure to a new central is finished. Upon disconnection, the application
 *          should use the Bond Manager API @ref ble_bondmngr_bonded_centrals_store to write the
 *          latest Bonding Information and System Attributes to flash.
 *
 *          The bond manager provides the API @ref ble_bondmngr_sys_attr_store to allow the
 *          application to write the System Attributes to flash while in a connection. Your
 *          application should call this API when it considers that all CCCDs and other persistent
 *          attributes are in a stable state. This API call will safely fail if System Attributes
 *          data for the current connected central is already present in the flash. The API does so
 *          because a flash write in such a situation would require an erase of flash, which takes a
 *          long time (21 milliseconds) to complete. This may disrupt the radio.
 *
 *          Applications using the Bond Manager must have a configuration file named
 *          ble_bondmngr_cfg.h (see below for details).
 *
 *          Refer to @ref ble_bond_mgr_msc to see the flow of events when connecting to a central
 *          using the Bond Manager
 *
 *
 * @section ble_sdk_lib_bond_manager_cfg Configuration File
 * Applications using the Bond Manager must have a configuration file named ble_bondmngr_cfg.h.
 * Here is an example of this file:
 *
 * @code
 * #ifndef BLE_BONDMNGR_CFG_H__
 * #define BLE_BONDMNGR_CFG_H__
 *
 * #define BLE_BONDMNGR_CCCD_COUNT           1
 * #define BLE_BONDMNGR_MAX_BONDED_CENTRALS  4
 *
 * #endif // BLE_BONDMNGR_CFG_H__
 * @endcode
 *
 * BLE_BONDMNGR_CCCD_COUNT is the number of CCCDs used in the application, and
 * BLE_BONDMNGR_MAX_BONDED_CENTRALS is the maximum number of bonded centrals to be supported by the
 * application.
