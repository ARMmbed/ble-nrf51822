 * @ingroup  app_common
 *
 * @brief    HCI transport module implementation.
 *
 * This module implements certain specific features from the three-wire UART transport layer, 
 * defined by the Bluetooth specification version 4.0 [Vol 4] part D.
 *
 * \par Features supported
 * - Transmission and reception of Vendor Specific HCI packet type application packets.
 * - Transmission and reception of reliable packets: defined by chapter 6 of the specification.
 *
 * \par Features not supported
 * - Link establishment procedure: defined by chapter 8 of the specification.
 * - Low power: defined by chapter 9 of the specification. 
 *
 * \par Implementation specific behaviour
 * - As Link establishment procedure is not supported following static link configuration parameters
 * are used:
 * + TX window size is 1.
 * + 16 bit CCITT-CRC must be used.
 * + Out of frame software flow control not supported.
 * + Parameters specific for resending reliable packets are compile time configurable (clarifed 
 * later in this document).
 * + Acknowledgement packet transmissions are not timeout driven , meaning they are delivered for 
 * transmission within same context which the corresponding application packet was received. 
 *
 * \par Implementation specific limitations
 * Current implementation has the following limitations which will have impact to system wide 
 * behaviour:
 * - Delayed acknowledgement scheduling not implemented: 
 * There exists a possibility that acknowledgement TX packet and application TX packet will collide 
 * in the TX pipeline having the end result that acknowledgement packet will be excluded from the TX 
 * pipeline which will trigger the retransmission algorithm within the peer protocol entity.
 * - Delayed retransmission scheduling not implemented:  
 * There exists a possibility that retransmitted application TX packet and acknowledgement TX packet
 * will collide in the TX pipeline having the end result that retransmitted application TX packet 
 * will be excluded from the TX pipeline.
 * - Processing of the acknowledgement number from RX application packets:
 * Acknowledgement number is not processed from the RX application packets having the end result 
 * that unnecessary application packet retransmissions can occur.
 *
 * The application TX packet processing flow is illustrated by the statemachine below. 
 *
 * @image html hci_transport_tx_sm.png "TX - application packet statemachine"
 *
 * \par Component specific configuration options
 *
 * The following compile time configuration options are available, and used to configure the 
 * application TX packet retransmission interval, in order to suite various application specific 
 * implementations:
 * - MAC_PACKET_SIZE_IN_BITS Maximum size of a single application packet in bits. 
 * - USED_BAUD_RATE Used uart baudrate. 
 *
 * The following compile time configuration option is available to configure module specific 
 * behaviour:
 * - MAX_RETRY_COUNT Max retransmission retry count for applicaton packets.
