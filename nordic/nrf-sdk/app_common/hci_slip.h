 * @brief SLIP layer for supporting packet framing in HCI transport.
 *
 * @details This module implements SLIP packet framing as described in the Bluetooth Core
 *          Specification 4.0, Volume 4, Part D, Chapter 3 SLIP Layer.
 *
 *          SLIP framing ensures that all packets sent on the UART are framed as:
 *          <0xC0> SLIP packet 1 <0xC0> <0xC0> SLIP packet 2 <0xC0>.
 *
 *          The SLIP layer uses events to notify the upper layer when data transmission is complete
 *          and when a SLIP packet is received.
