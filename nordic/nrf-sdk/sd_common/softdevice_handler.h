 *           For more information on the library and how the application should use it, please refer
 *           @ref lib_softdevice_handler.
 *
 * @note     Use the USE_SCHEDULER parameter of the SOFTDEVICE_HANDLER_INIT() macro to select if
 *           the @ref app_scheduler is to be used or not.
 *
 * @note     Even if the scheduler is not used, softdevice_handler.h will include app_scheduler.h.
 *           So when compiling, app_scheduler.h must be available in one of the compiler include
 *           paths.

 * @note       Normally initialization should be done using the SOFTDEVICE_HANDLER_INIT() macro,

 *
 * @param[in]  clock_source        Low frequency clock source to be used by the SoftDevice.
 * @param[in]  p_evt_buffer        Buffer for holding one stack event. Since heap is not being
 *                                 used, this buffer must be provided by the application. The
 *                                 buffer must be large enough to hold the biggest stack event the
 *                                 application is supposed to handle. The buffer must be aligned to
 *                                 a 4 byte boundary. This parameter is unused if neither BLE nor

 *                                 BLE stack support is not required.
 * @param[in]  evt_schedule_func   Function for passing events to the scheduler. Point to
 *                                 ble_ant_stack_evt_schedule() to connect to the scheduler.
 *                                 Set to NULL to make the stack handler module call the event
 *                                 handler directly from the stack event interrupt handler.
 *
 * @retval     NRF_SUCCESS               Successful initialization.
 * @retval     NRF_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM   Invalid parameter (buffer not aligned to a 4 byte
