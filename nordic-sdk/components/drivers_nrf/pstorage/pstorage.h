 * @retval     NRF_SUCCESS             on success, else an error code indicating reason for failure.

 *             procedure is complete. Application is notified of procedure completion using
 *             notification callback registered by the application. 'result' parameter of the
 *             callback suggests if the procedure was successful or not.
